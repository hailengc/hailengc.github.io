I am a software engineer and an under-training artist. I am a fan of [Ruby and Javascript](/coding/misc/2018/11/24/less-ruby-more-javascript.html) and I love doing things related to audio, visualization(2D/3D) and interaction.

With this blog, I would like to share topics on coding, design and sentiment of my life - hope it can bring you some interesting thoughts. You can reach me via ðŸ“§: _hailengc@gmail.com_.
