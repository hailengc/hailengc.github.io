I am a Web engineer and a fan of `Ruby`. I' currently using `Javascript` (`React/Express`) extensively in my work. In my spare itme, I love doing things related to audio, visualization(2D/3D) and interaction.

With this blog, I would like to share topics on coding, design and sentiment of my life - hope it can bring you some interesting thoughts.
