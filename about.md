Hey, I'm a full-stack web engineer in Shanghai (China). I love topics on coding skills and architecture design. I use `Ruby`, `Python`, `Javascript` (with `Vue.js`) quite a lot in my job and side projects and I'm diving into `Go` these days. Also, as I have a computer graphic background, `WebGL` is something on my TODO list.

Hope that I can share something that you might think it's worth to share with other people or have a luck to live in your bookmark folder.
