After spent one day on Jekyll - reading [doc](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/), test on local machine - finally push up to my github pages. Fantastic!

Jekyll is simple and embraces a clean architecture, that means once you get into it, everything is easy to tweak. If you have a ruby background (I'm lucky to have :) ), things will be even simpler.

One drawback of github pages is that it only supports [limited  gem based themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/), to workaround this you can use [remote theme](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site/#adding-a-jekyll-theme-in-your-sites-_configyml-file) or just [convert gem based themes to regular themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#converting-gem-based-themes-to-regular-themes):

I'm diving into Go these days,  [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a competitor for Jekyll - it clams to be super fast (for thousands of posts maybe), definitely worth to give it a try. 

If you are finding tools to build a blog or static website, both __Jekyll + Github Pages__ and __Hugo + Netlify__ are good choices.

As my blog on Github Pages is up and running, I'll start using it and once I have a chance to play with Hugo, I will write a blog to compare with these two.
