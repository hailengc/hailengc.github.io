I've been keeping this domain [musicuni.com](www.musicuni.com) for years and finally, something at least runnable is set up. The purpose of this site - at least for now - is for people who make music to have a way of sharing their work.

The implementation is built on React (Antd and Tailwind.css for the UI) and Express. The whole logic is simple: upload music file and share the play link to others. Things on the TODO list:

1. User and login (via google/facebook)
2. Likes and comments
3. Album support
4. Online editing (Hard)
5. ...

It will not be a next soundcloud, it's just a small site. I'm glad it is running.
