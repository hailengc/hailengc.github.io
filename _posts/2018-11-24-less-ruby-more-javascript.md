I've been using more and more javascript since last year and it became my main language. On the other hand, I use ruby less and less - though I still love using it to write script or solve algorithm problems - the fact is, Javascript is expanding its applicable scope to **everywhere**.

I used to be a happy Ruby programmer about 5 years ago when I just ran out of the world of C++ and Java. Ruby to me was like an angel, it leads me to realize the beauty and elegance of programming language - it still impacting me deeply on the concept: `coding for human, not machine`. I remembered once a colleague asked me why I always talking about Ruby, and I wrote him something like this:

```Ruby
Marven.ensure do |task|
   tell_me if task.done?
end
```

Ruby syntax is so semantically friend - you can even make it feel like nature language. At that time I was so crazy about Ruby, from Rack to Rails, wrote almost everything use Ruby. I looked down on other languages. "Ruby is the only language I will use if you want me to do this" - I did said that ðŸ˜‚.

However, things are changing so quickly in this world, especially in web frontend. Angular first caught my eye, it shocked me as a component based framework. Then Phonegap (Cordova) moved fast to offer you a way to write hybrid app use your frontend skills. Then React comes up with a good friend named "React Native" to enable you to build a real **native** app. Server side node frameworks, if you take a look at [this list](http://nodeframework.com/), from "Sinatra like" to "Rails like" to "REST api", everything is there. Don't forget there is another desktop beast called [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)

We have to admit, ES6, frontend frameworks(Angular/React/Vue) and Node give Javascript a new life - and the rise of Javascript will keep a long time.

Ruby is doing well and Rails is doing well, they are just like old friends to me, so intimate. Matz said Ruby 3 will be 3 times faster than Ruby 2, that is so exciting for every ruby programmer. I will keep using Ruby whenever I can, but I can't avoid writing Javascirpt more and more ðŸ˜ƒ.
