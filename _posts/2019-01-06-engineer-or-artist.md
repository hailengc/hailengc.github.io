**_"Could you please introduce yourself?"_**

"Sure, I'm a Software Engineer ..."

**_"Wait, so, what's your daily work?"_**

"Well, I write code..."

**_"Writing code for what? "_**

"Ok... for web applications like a website your can buy something, or a search site like google you can do the searching... "

**_"And?"_**

"And, games, music applications, basically everything is achievable - just use the programming language."

**"Wow, I got it. Sounds like artist, you can build whatever you want - am I right?"**

"Yes your are. A good software engineer is an artist with elegant design in both external and internal. Well, I could have told you, I'm an under-training artist."

**_"That's cool!"_**
